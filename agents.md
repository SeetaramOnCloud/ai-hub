**Technical Note:** These applications are embedded directly from Hugging Face Spaces. Loading times may vary.
The `<gradio-app>` web component script is usually loaded automatically by the component itself.
If you face issues, you might need to explicitly add `<script type="module" src="https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4.16.0/gradio.js"></script>` (or the latest version) to your theme's layout, typically in the `<head>` section of `_layouts/default.html` if your theme doesn't handle it. However, try without it first.
